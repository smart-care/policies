_Last Updated: July 12, 2019_

The following Terms of Service (“Terms”, “Agreement”) represent a legal agreement between You and Smartcare, LLC (“Smartcare”). Please read this agreement carefully, as it governs your use of Smartcare’s (“Smartcare”) services, including Smartcare’s website (www.smartcare.io) and any other websites that we may later own or operate (“Site(s)”); mobile applications (“App(s)”), application program interface(s) (“API(s)”) and other products and services we may later own or operate (collectively called “Services”). Violation of any of the terms below may result in the termination of your account.

## Agreement to these Terms

By using our Services, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions set forth herein. If you don’t agree to these terms, do not use the services. If you are accessing and using the Services on behalf of a company (such as your employer) or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company or other legal entity to these Terms. In that case, “you” and “your” will refer to that company or other legal entity. If you do not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, you may not accept this agreement nor may you use the services or receive services hereunder.

## Changes to the Terms or Services

We may modify the Terms at any time, in our sole discretion. If we do so, we’ll let you know either by posting the modified Terms on the Site or through other communications. If you continue to use the Services, you are indicating that you agree to the modified Terms. We may change or discontinue all or any part of the Services, at any time and without notice, at our sole discretion.

### Provision of the Platform
