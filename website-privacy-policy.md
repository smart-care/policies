# Smartcare Privacy Policy
_Last Updated: December 13, 2018_

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit smartcare.io (the “Site”).

### What Information Do We Collect?
When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”

### We collect Device Information using the following technologies:
“**Cookies**” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit http://www.allaboutcookies.org. “**Log files**” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps. “**Web beacons**,” “**tags**,” and “**pixels**” are electronic files used to record information about how you browse the Site.

Additionally, when a visitor to the Site enters information requesting a demo or applying for employment, we collect the visitor’s email address, contact and/or other information so that we may fulfill the visitor’s request. Some information provided to us may, either alone or when connected with other information to which we may have access, individually identify a visitor or user, and that information may be referred to in this Privacy Policy as “Personal Information.”

Please note that we do not alter our Site’s data collection and use practices when we see a Do Not Track signal from your browser, as we do not collect off-site tracking data. 

### How Do We Use Your Personal Information?
Smartcare uses information, including Personal Information, provided by you to fulfill your request for further information. Personalized marketing emails and product updates may also be sent on occasion, and if applicable. You can opt out of correspondence anytime by emailing sales@smartcare.io.

Further, if you apply for a job via the Site, we will collect, process and store the information you provide to us for recruitment purposes. We may also retain some of your information for a reasonable period of time for purposes of considering you for future positions.

Smartcare will not share your Personal Information, or otherwise, make your Personal Information available to any other parties except as provided in this Privacy Policy. We will not sell, rent, or exchange your Personal Information with any third parties without permission from you.

We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).

### Do We Share Your Personal Information?
We share your Personal Information only with select third parties who help us use your Personal Information, as described above.  For example, we use Google Analytics to help us understand how our customers use the Site--you can read more about how Google uses your Personal Information here:  https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/.  You can also opt-out of Google Analytics here:  https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout.

We may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.

When you enter Personal Information on our Site, we will maintain your personal information for our records unless and until you ask us to delete this information.

### Updates to this Privacy Policy
We will update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.
